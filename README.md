# Ora Property Management

A modern, enterprise-grade property management system built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Supabase.

⚠️ **Migration Status**: Authentication is now consolidated on Supabase Auth. Remaining references to NextAuth in docs/env have been removed.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash

npm install

```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your local development credentials. See [Environment Setup Guide](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**Important**: Use different Supabase projects for local development vs production to ensure your live environment is protected.

### 3. Set Up Supabase Database

```bash
# Apply migrations through Supabase dashboard SQL editor
# Import migration files from supabase/migrations/ in order
# Follow the complete setup guide in docs/database/SUPABASE_SETUP.md
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
