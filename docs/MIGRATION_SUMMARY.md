# Migration Summary: Prisma/NextAuth → Supabase Architecture

## Executive Summary

The Ora Property Management system has undergone a **significant architectural

transformation** from a hybrid Prisma/NextAuth setup to a Supabase-based

architecture. This migration enhances performance, reduces complexity, and
provides a unified platform for database operations, authentication, and
real-time features.

**Current Status**: **80% Complete** (Hybrid State)

**Completion Target**: Q1 2025

**Business Impact**: Minimal downtime, improved performance

  - Row Level Security (RLS) implementation

**Technical Details:**

- 5 comprehensive database migrations
- Complete schema redesign for property management
- UUID-based primary keys for scalability
- Comprehensive indexing strategy

- **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

- **Business Impact**: Enhanced security, simplified auth flow

**Required Work:**

- Remove NextAuth dependency
- Implement Supabase Auth context provider
- Create sign-in/sign-up pages
- Implement protected route middleware
- Update session management

### ❌ Frontend Auth Integration (PENDING)

- **Current State**: NextAuth hooks and components

- **Target State**: Supabase Auth hooks and components

- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

- **Business Impact**: Consistent user experience

### ❌ Production Security Hardening (PENDING)

- **Current State**: Basic RLS policies ("allow all")

- **Target State**: User-specific RLS policies

- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

- **Business Impact**: Enhanced data security
