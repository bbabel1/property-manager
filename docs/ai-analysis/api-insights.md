## Overview

The API follows RESTful conventions with proper authentication and error handling. The property management domain is
well-represented through intuitive endpoint design.

## Key Insights

- Authentication is properly implemented using Supabase Auth
- API routes follow consistent naming conventions
- Error handling is comprehensive across all endpoints
- Business logic is appropriately separated from presentation

## Recommendations

- Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Consider implementing API versioning
- Add detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Endpoint Analysis

- **GET /api/properties**: Well-designed for property listing with proper pagination

- **POST /api/properties**: Good validation but could benefit from more detailed error messages

- **GET /api/owners/{id}/properties**: Excellent use of dynamic routing for owner-specific data

## Security Considerations

- Authentication tokens are properly validated
- Input sanitization is in place
- CORS is appropriately configured
- Consider adding request signing for sensitive operations

## AI Insights

- RESTful API design follows best practices
- Authentication is properly implemented
- Error handling is consistent across endpoints

## AI Recommendations

- Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Consider API versioning strategy
