# Double-Entry Vulnerabilities

This document will capture known and potential vulnerabilities in the double-entry validation implementation, including:

- Scenarios that could allow unbalanced transactions
- Edge cases around rounding and tolerances
- Failure modes for trigger and function errors
- Operational risks during migrations or backfills

As issues are discovered and mitigations are applied, add concise
entries here so the implementation summary can link to a single
source of truth.
