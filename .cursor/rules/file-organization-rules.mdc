File Organization Rules:

1. **Follow Next.js conventions**: Use conventional naming, structure, and file 
   placement for Next.js + TypeScript projects.

2. **Maintain stable file paths**: Keep file paths and exports stable during 
   refactors to avoid breaking existing imports.

3. **Prefer additive refactors**: Use additive, small focused refactors without 
   removing existing business logic when possible.

4. **Use consistent directory structure**: 
   - src/lib/ for utility functions and shared logic
   - src/types/ for TypeScript type definitions
   - scripts/ for utility and automation scripts
   - docs/ for project documentation
   - supabase/migrations/ for database migrations

5. **Group related files**: Organize files logically by feature or functionality 
   rather than by type.

6. **Use descriptive file names**: Choose file names that clearly indicate their 
   purpose and content.

7. **Maintain import organization**: Keep imports organized and use consistent 
   import patterns throughout the project.

8. **Separate concerns**: Keep different types of logic (UI, business logic, 
   data access) properly separated in appropriate directories.
