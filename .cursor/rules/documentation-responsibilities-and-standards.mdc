Maintain professional docs:

- Keep README, API, component, database, and architecture docs current.
- When code changes, update only the relevant section(s) and preserve manual edits.
- Use concise, professional language with examples and “why” rationale.
- Call out business rules, constraints, and assumptions.
- Provide diff-friendly edits (small, targeted updates).
