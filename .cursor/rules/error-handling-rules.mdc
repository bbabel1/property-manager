Error Handling Rules:

1. **Surface errors transparently**: Never hide or suppress errors; always surface 
   them transparently with clear, actionable information.

2. **Never claim success unless verified**: Don't claim success unless the operation 
   has been verified to work correctly.

3. **Handle routine operations automatically**: Handle routine/native operations 
   without being explicitly asked when they're clearly needed for the task.

4. **Remove temporary files**: Always clean up test scripts and temporary files 
   before finishing any task.

5. **Log actionable context**: Log information that helps with debugging and 
   troubleshooting, but never log secrets, API keys, or personally identifiable 
   information (PII).

6. **Use consistent error formats**: Implement consistent error response formats 
   across all API endpoints and functions.

7. **Provide clear error messages**: Error messages should be clear, actionable, 
   and help developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

8. **Handle edge cases**: Consider and handle edge cases, especially when dealing 
   with external APIs or database operations.
