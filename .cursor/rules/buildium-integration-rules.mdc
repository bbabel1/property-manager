Buildium Integration Rules:

1. **Official API documentation priority**: 
   - ALWAYS reference the indexed "Open API, powered by Buildium (v1)" documentation first for any Buildium API questions
   - Use this official OpenAPI spec as the authoritative source for endpoints, request/response schemas, and API behavior
   - ALWAYS reference docs/BUILDIUM_API_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for authentication patterns and script templates
   - ALWAYS reference docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md for script patterns and quick commands
   - Use docs/buildium-integration-guide.md for complex integration scenarios
   - Use docs/buildium-authentication-guide.md for authentication issues
   - Use docs/buildium-property-import-guide.md for property-specific operations

2. **Use live database for inspection**: Always query the live Supabase database when 
   inspecting data to avoid confusion with local database state.

3. **Test with real API responses**: Always test mappers and functions with actual 
   Buildium API responses, not just type definitions from src/types/buildium.ts.

4. **Handle API limitations**: Implement proper rate limiting, pagination, and error 
   handling for all Buildium API calls.

5. **Log appropriately**: Log actionable context for debugging, but never log secrets, 
   API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII).

6. **Validate responses**: Always validate Buildium API responses before processing 
   to ensure data integrity and prevent runtime errors.

7. **Use org-scoped credentials (CRITICAL)**: 
   - NEVER use `process.env.BUILDIUM_*` directly in code
   - ALL credential access must flow through `getOrgScopedBuildiumConfig()` in `src/lib/buildium/credentials-manager.ts`
   - This is the ONLY place that should read `process.env.BUILDIUM_*` variables
   - Use `getOrgScopedBuildiumClient(orgId)` or `buildiumFetch(..., orgId)` for API calls
   - Pass `orgId` parameter (or `undefined` for system jobs without org context)

8. **Handle relationship resolution**: When dealing with related data (e.g., 
   properties with bank accounts), use systematic resolution patterns with proper 
   error handling.

9. **Document field mappings**: Maintain clear documentation of field mappings 
   between Buildium API responses and local database schema.

10. **Use org-scoped Buildium client/fetch**: Always use the centralized credential manager:
    ```typescript
    // ✅ CORRECT: Use org-scoped client
    const orgId = await resolveOrgId(request, userId)
    const client = await getOrgScopedBuildiumClient(orgId)
    const properties = await client.getProperties()
    
    // ✅ CORRECT: Use org-scoped fetch
    const result = await buildiumFetch('GET', '/rentals', {}, undefined, orgId)
    
    // ❌ WRONG: Direct process.env usage
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.BUILDIUM_BASE_URL}/rentals`, {
      headers: {
        'x-buildium-client-id': process.env.BUILDIUM_CLIENT_ID!,
        'x-buildium-client-secret': process.env.BUILDIUM_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      }
    })
    ```

12. **Quick script creation**: Use existing scripts in scripts/buildium/sync/ as templates
    and modify for specific entities and IDs.

13. **Environment loading**: Always use dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' }) in scripts
    to ensure proper environment variable loading.

14. **Quick reference commands**: Use the patterns from docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md for:
    - Creating temporary scripts for specific entities
    - Environment variable checks
    - Standard script templates
    - Common API endpoints
