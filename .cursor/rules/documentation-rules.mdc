Documentation Rules:

1. **Keep documentation current**: Maintain README, API, component, database, and 
   architecture documentation to reflect the current state of the project.

2. **Update relevant sections only**: When code changes, update only the relevant 
   documentation sections and preserve any manual edits made by developers.

3. **Use professional language**: Write documentation using concise, professional 
   language with clear examples and explanations of "why" decisions were made.

4. **Call out business rules**: Document business rules, constraints, and assumptions 
   that affect how the system operates.

5. **Provide diff-friendly edits**: Make small, targeted documentation updates that 
   are easy to review and understand.

6. **Include examples**: Provide practical examples in documentation to help 
   developers understand how to use the system correctly.

7. **Document architecture decisions**: Explain the rationale behind architectural 
   choices and design patterns used in the project.

8. **Maintain API documentation**: Keep API documentation up-to-date with current 
   endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
