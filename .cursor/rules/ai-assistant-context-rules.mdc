AI Assistant Context Rules:

1. **Environment variable limitations**: AI assistants cannot access process.env directly
   - Always use scripts with dotenv.config() for environment access
   - Never try to access environment variables in direct code

2. **Script execution pattern**: 
   - Create scripts in scripts/buildium/sync/ directory
   - Use existing scripts as templates
   - Always clean up temporary scripts after use

3. **Buildium API access**: 
   - Use direct API calls, not MCP tools
   - Follow authentication pattern with client credentials
   - Use proper error handling and logging

4. **File creation limitations**: 
   - Cannot create files directly in some contexts
   - Use terminal commands or provide file content for manual creation
   - Always verify file creation before proceeding

5. **Error handling expectations**:
   - Expect environment loading issues
   - Handle missing dependencies gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages and solutions

6. **Quick reference usage**: 
   - Always check docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md first
   - Use established patterns from existing scripts
   - Follow project conventions for naming and structure

7. **Common workflow for API requests**:
   - Copy existing script template
   - Modify for target entity/ID
   - Run with npx tsx
   - Clean up temporary files
   - Document results
