-- Deprecated remote patch: extend lease_contact_role_enum with additional roles.
--
-- Phase 1 single-source-of-truth goal:
--   Only Supabase migrations under supabase/migrations/ should define or
--   modify the canonical database schema (including enums).
--
-- This file is retained for historical context only and MUST NOT be used
-- to apply schema changes. If you need to adjust enum values, add a new
-- migration instead.
