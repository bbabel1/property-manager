-- Deprecated remote patch: Phase 2 lease/supporting schema changes.
--
-- Phase 1 single-source-of-truth goal:
--   Only Supabase migrations under supabase/migrations/ should encode
--   these schema changes.
--
-- This file is retained for historical context only and MUST NOT be used
-- to apply schema changes. If you need to evolve the lease/supporting
-- schema, add a new migration instead.
