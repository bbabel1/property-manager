## Overview
The API follows RESTful conventions with proper authentication and error handling. The property management domain is well-represented through intuitive endpoint design.

## Key Insights
- Authentication is properly implemented using NextAuth.js
- API routes follow consistent naming conventions
- Error handling is comprehensive across all endpoints
- Business logic is appropriately separated from presentation

## Recommendations
- Implement rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Consider implementing API versioning
- Add detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Endpoint Analysis
- **GET /api/properties**: Well-designed for property listing with proper pagination
- **POST /api/properties**: Good validation but could benefit from more detailed error messages
- **GET /api/owners/{id}/properties**: Excellent use of dynamic routing for owner-specific data

## Security Considerations
- Authentication tokens are properly validated
- Input sanitization is in place
- CORS is appropriately configured
- Consider adding request signing for sensitive operations`,
